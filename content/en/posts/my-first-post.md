# 👋 Welcome and nice to meet you!

Thanks for stopping by — this blog is where I share my thoughts, experiences, and things that are meaningful to me.

💻 By profession, I'm a web application developer.
Currently, I lead a small team — we build cool stuff and learn from each other every day.

🏃‍♂️ Outside of work, it's all about sports: running, swimming, cycling, and the gym.  
I can't live without training and love exploring the limits of my capabilities, especially when preparing for and competing in races.  
In the past, I was a professional track cyclist and a member of the Russian national team (sprint).

🌍 On this blog, I plan to write about:
- **development** — sharing knowledge and insights from the .NET and web world;
- **sports** — how I train while working full-time, and what discipline gives back;
- **travel** — I've lived in Armenia, Georgia, and currently Vietnam. Next up (hopefully): Europe and the US.

🙏 Thanks again for visiting. If anything resonates with you — I'd love to hear your feedback!
